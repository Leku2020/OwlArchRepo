# GitHub Actions Pipeline for Building PKGBUILDs and Deploying Pages

## Overview
This GitHub Actions pipeline automates the process of building Arch Linux packages from `PKGBUILD` files, generating documentation pages with Jekyll, and deploying the output to GitHub Pages. It supports feature branch builds and main branch deployments.

## Workflow Triggers
The pipeline runs under the following conditions:
- On every push to the `main` branch
- On every push to branches following the pattern `feature/**`
- Manually triggered via `workflow_dispatch`

## Jobs Breakdown
### 1. `build_packages`
Builds the Arch Linux packages from `PKGBUILD` files.

**Steps:**
- Checkout the repository
- Run an Arch Linux container to:
  - Create a `builder` user
  - Install required dependencies (`sudo`, `base-devel`, `git`)
  - Locate all `PKGBUILD` files and run `makepkg -si`
  - Move built `.pkg.tar.zst` files to `output_dir`
- Upload the generated package artifacts to GitHub

### 2. `build_pages`
Builds Jekyll-based documentation pages.

**Steps:**
- Checkout the repository
- Set up GitHub Pages
- Install Ruby and Jekyll dependencies
- Copy markdown files from `extra/` to `pages/`
- Run `jekyll build` to generate static pages
- Upload the generated pages as an artifact

### 3. `prepare_deploy_artifact`
Combines package artifacts and Jekyll-generated pages into a final deployment package.

**Steps:**
- Download artifacts from `build_packages` and `build_pages`
- Copy `.pkg.tar.zst` files into `/pkgs/x86_64/`
- Run `repo-add` inside an Arch Linux container to update the package database
- Merge Jekyll build output into the deployment directory
- Upload the combined artifact for deployment

### 4. `deploy`
Deploys the prepared artifact to GitHub Pages.

**Steps:**
- Deploy `deploy_artifact` using `actions/deploy-pages`

### 5. `detect_modified_paths`
Detects modified files in feature branches and selectively builds affected packages.

**Steps:**
- Checkout the repository
- Compare changes against `main`
- Identify modified directories within `extra/`
- Build only the affected packages
- Upload the modified package artifacts

## Conditional Execution
- The `build_pages`, `prepare_deploy_artifact`, and `deploy` jobs run only when pushing to `main`
- The `detect_modified_paths` job runs only for feature branches

## Artifact Management
- `build_packages_artifact`: Contains compiled Arch Linux packages
- `build_pages_artifact`: Contains Jekyll-generated HTML files
- `deploy_artifact`: Combines package repository and documentation pages

## Deployment URL
The final deployed website is available at the GitHub Pages environment URL defined in the pipeline.

This workflow ensures efficient package management and documentation deployment for an Arch Linux repository while maintaining CI/CD best practices.
